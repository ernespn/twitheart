twitheart
=========

map of twitter in nodejs


+ server side to read from twitter stream API
+ client to display the twitter in a map using D3js
+ nginx as a webserver
+ build script using fabric (python) to deploy to different environment (it looks like is not quite working for some environments)


You can see it working [here](http://twitter.ernespn.com) (be patient it takes a little bit to connect to twitter)
